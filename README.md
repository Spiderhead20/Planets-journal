# Planets journal.

Hello there! This is a small project featuring info about the planets in our solar system, here's an overview of the whole system:

This projects was done using React technology; by having JSX in order to display html content inside a JS file and using components in order to organise the page. Tthe main thing here is the fact that there's a Planet/card component that handles the information of each planet, so all of the data comes from a separate file, which means that if you were to add another planet (a finctional one or a light years away one), you could just add the neccesary information about that new planet inside the src/PlanetData file.
